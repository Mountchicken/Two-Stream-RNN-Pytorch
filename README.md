# Welcome!ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ
Hello Guys! It has been a really long long long time ever since my last repository. I am busy at some funcy work which will be released by the next month( when I passed the final examinationðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£) Anyway, if I am busy, then why would i creat this repository?

## Why implement a 2017 CVPR paper in 2021 which I am not even interested in :(
This repository is one of my final examination, '*Deep Learning and Computer Vision*' ðŸ˜…. I tried to find some implementation of this paper on github before, but all i got is 404 error.ðŸ˜… So me and my teammates decided to do it ourselves. The DeadLine is at July 1th, and before that i will realesd all the codes (which haven't been done yet, sry)

# model
`due to the limitation of time, we will only train on __NTU RGB+D dataset__ . 25 joints are labeled for each person, and the original paper only have 20 joints for each skeleton, so the architecture of the two rnn have been modeified to fit the dataset. Check the code for details.
